**Java Swing Connect Four Game**

This repository houses a classic Connect Four game implementation using Java Swing. The game is played on a 7-column, 6-row grid, with players taking turns to place their pieces. The first player to align four of their pieces in any direction (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal) is declared the winner.

Features:

1. **Two-Player Game**: Connect Four is played between two players, taking turns to place their pieces in the grid.

2. **Winning Conditions Checked**: The program checks for winning conditions after every move, ensuring the game concludes as soon as a player aligns four pieces.

3. **Interactive GUI**: The game utilizes Java Swing to present a simple and interactive graphical user interface. The grid is represented by buttons, and players place their pieces by clicking on the buttons.

4. **Reset Functionality**: The game can be easily reset mid-way or at the end, using the reset button provided in the GUI.

To run the game, simply execute the `ApplicationRunner` class. Enjoy this digital rendition of the timeless Connect Four game!
